As of November 2025, I am focussing on:

**Projects**

- Starting as PI on an ESRC-funded grant, [MRP-SMART](https://www.roger-beecham.com/mrp-smart/proposal/), a collaboration with [FINDS](https://smartdatafoundry.com/solutions/financial-data-service). We'll produce code and data products that apply MRP (and Bayesian hierarchical modelling) to generate de-biased estimates of population outcomes from non-representative smart data.
-  The EPSRC-funded [INFUZE](https://in-fuze.org.uk/) programme led by [Greg Mardsen](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/transport/staff/958/professor-greg-marsden). I'm working with some excellent PDRAs and PGRs on developing and communicating data-driven models that simulate and evaluate policy interventions to reduce car dependency.
- The NIHR-funded [PHIRST REACH](https://www.fundingawards.nihr.ac.uk/award/NIHR170113), a 5-year programme in which we perform quantitative impact evaluations on public health interventions related to transport and the environment.

**Larger papers**

-  Follow-up work from my [Turing Methods Challenge Fortnight](https://theory4ida.github.io/tmcf/), with [Cagatay Turkay](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/cim/people/cagatay-turkay/). Coming soon is our paper on [***WIDE*** *data analysis*](https://theory4ida.github.io/tmcf/files/slides/workshop.html#/27) -- and a call for Expressions of Interest for our linked Special Issue. 

**Supervision**

- [Juan P. Fonseca-Zamora](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography/pgr/11291/juan-p-fonseca-zamora) (w/ [Robin Lovelace](https://www.robinlovelace.net/) + [James Tate](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/transport/staff/980/dr-james-tate))
-  [Juliana Novaes Bueno de Camargo](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography/pgr/11302/juliana-novaes) (w/ [Dan Birks](https://essl.leeds.ac.uk/law/staff/261/dr-daniel-birks))
- [Seán Ó Héir](https://sohanseth.github.io/author/sean-o-heir/) (w/ [Sohan Seth](https://sohanseth.github.io/) and [Gary Watmough](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/gary-watmough))
