### STATS19 Road Crash Data

???

Starting point :
* Every crash resulting in injury in UK is recorded
* Many variables

With DfT -- set of high-level ambitions :
* Knowledge around contributing factors to pedestrian and cycle casualties
* Monitoring and evaluating crash rates between reporting areas and over time

Identified numerous interesting and complex patterns from exploring data.
But ones that we have varying confidence in due to uncertainty around:
* dataset (collection)
* techniques and reporting

So quite difficult to *claim knowledge* -- or to know where to stop in our exploratory analysis.

Typical in a lot of Data Science-type work, certainly in geography, where repurposing data for analysis:

* analysis space is wide --
* looking at complex spatial processes where inferences are made about multiple features concurrently

???

This places Geog and our analysis in a difficult position given the current zeitgeist around scientific reform.

Science Reform and Replication crisis :


* Two discrete phases : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA). That only through CDA statistical findings are claimed using out-of-sample hypothesis tests.

* But for the reasons I described, difficult to do. Pre-register, find other datasets.

Also:

* Pre-registration may lock researchers into faulty analysis plan -- does not guarantee statistical rigour. Pre-registration may *prevent* necessary/proper conditioning and may lead to staw-men null hypotheses.

* in this paper by Devezer et al. the key tenets/claims of the science reform movement are questioned -- along with their statistical validity.

* Key argument around the eda-cda dichotomy is that as it is about discovery EDA requires a broader approach analysis.
* But that it needs rigour to serve the intended prupose of scientific discovery -- it is about discovering *generalisations*. EDA is usually an iterative process of model specification, residual analysis, examination of assumptions, and model pre-specification... Whichever method is selected for EDA; however, it needs to be implemented rigorously to maximize the probability of true discoveries while minimizing the probability of false discoveries. Because the process of exploration is elusive and informal, it may not be possible to derive some minimum standards all exploratory studies need to meet.

1. exploratory research cannot be reduced to EDA. But
2. But when it is pursued it needs rigour and formal justifications


*  Nonetheless, some desirable qualities can be inferred from successful implementation of exploratory approaches in different fields: (i) as suggested by Russell’s quote, exploration needs to start with subject matter expertise or theoretical background, and hence, cannot be decontextualized, free of theory, or completely dictated by the data [83,102,104,105,111,113]; (ii) the key for running successful exploratory studies is the richness of data [122]. Random datasets that are uninformative about the area to be explored will probably not yield important discoveries; (iii) exploration requires robust methods that are insensitive to underlying assumptions [105]. As such, rather than misusing or abusing standard procedures for inferential statistics, using robust approaches such as multiverse analysis [86] or metastudies [123] could be more appropriate for exploration purposes; and (iv) exploratory work needs to be done in a structured, systematic, honest and transparent manner using a deliberately chosen methodology appropriate for the task [10,122].




Wagenmakers et al. [13, p. 634] argue that purely exploratory research is one that finds hypotheses in the data by post hoc theorizing and using inferential statistics in a ‘wonky’ manner (borrowing Wagenmakers et al.’s [13] terminology) where p-values and error rates lose their meaning:

* Reproducibility -- analogous to replication here as not about transparency of methods. E.g providing sufficient details to reproduce results -- true results can be regularly reproduced, true false results can be regularly reproduced.

???

Interesting discussion from the vis / applied stats community about an enlarged EDA which is more model-focussed and concerned with generating complex models that also sensitive to false discovery.

Reformulates exploratory analysis (not EDA) as an explicitly model-based activity. Concerned with analysing observed patterns against candidate data generating processes. Graphics are essential to this: Graphics invite us to form comparisons and expectations -- and characterising variation from those expectations.

???

Framework for what this expanded, model-based exploratory analysis (not EDA) might involve.

* Three phases.


 But that it needs rigour to serve the intended prupose of scientific discovery -- it is about discovering *generalisations*. EDA is usually an iterative process of model specification, residual analysis, examination of assumptions, and model pre-specification... Whichever method is selected for EDA; however, it needs to be implemented rigorously to maximize the probability of true discoveries while minimizing the probability of false discoveries. Because the process of exploration is elusive and informal, it may not be possible to derive some minimum standards all exploratory studies need to meet.
