Hi! Thanks for visiting my website. If you find anything useful here, or on my [github](https://github.com/rogerbeecham), and would like to know more, do get in touch. Below is a *bio* I tend to use to describe myself:

> Roger Beecham is Associate Professor in Visual Data Science at University of Leeds. He joined Leeds in 2017 after completing a PhD and postdoc at the [giCentre](https://www.gicentre.net/). His research develops, applies and evaluates visualization techniques in the analysis of large social science datasets. This spans several disciplinary areas: Information Visualization, Spatial Statistics, Transport, Political Geography and Crime Science. He has published methodological research in top journals in Data Visualization (e.g. [IEEE TVCG](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=2945)) as well as applied studies in leading journals in Transport ([TRC](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/transportation-research-part-c-emerging-technologies)) and Geography ([E&P A](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/epn)).
