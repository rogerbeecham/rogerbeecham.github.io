But we need to consider more slippery things -- like values, beliefs, social learning -- if we really want to understand transformational change."

## Introduction

Through [Infuze](https://in-fuze.org.uk/) we will build models that simulate individuals' everyday travel activities and evaluate how well -- quickly, comfortably, affordably -- existing and newly proposed transport options support those activities. Attending to everyday journeys is undoubtly necessary. But people are not empty economic units.  It would be wrong to assume that individuals' transport behaviours can be reduced simply to efficiency in meeting, or 'utility maximising' their travel routines.  

In this short blog post, I take a look at data from the Census, the Department for Transport's [Journey Time Statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/journey-time-statistics) and [National Travel Attitudes Survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-travel-attitudes-study-ntas), and produce some graphics that profile how neighbourhoods in Leeds are already supported by transport alternatives to the car. In each I consider how transport provision maps to levels of car ownership and attitudes towards shifting away from car use. The point of this being that, if shifting behaviour away from car ownership and use were only about designing an enabling environment with viable car alternatives, then neighbourhoods with the best enabling context should be those the with the lowest levels of car ownership or willingness to shift ownership. 

## Car ownership in small area neighbourhoods of Leeds

First, let's introduce our units of analysis: Lower Super Output Areas. These are small area neighbourhoods containing roughly 1500 people.  There are 482 LSOAs in Leeds. 

In the map below I encode each as a square and colour the squares according to the average number of cars owned per household. I then reorder the neighbourhood squares highest to lowest on levels of car ownership. 


```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| echo: false

include_graphics("neighbourhoods.png", error = FALSE)

```

When contemplating an environment in which it is possible to live agreeably without a private car, it is hard not use the 15-minute city as a reference point -- despite the unfortunate (and silly) political loading. So in the remaining graphics I use this idea to evaluate neighbourhood-level transport provision.  

## The private car guarantees 15-minute travel for most neighbourhoods

 In the first example I colour squares according to average travel time by car to the nearest key activity services --  GPs, secondary schools and town centres.  Note the squares remain ordered by car ownership. As you might expect, the private car really does compress travel times. Almost every neighbourhood has key facilities accessible in less than a 15-minute journey, by car.

#| message: false
#| echo: false

include_graphics("access_car.png", error = FALSE)

```

TODO : Build in annotations

## Neighbourhoods with lower car ownership are (sometimes) those with better non-car options 

Next, the issue we're really interested in. If shifting individuals away from private car use was **only** about the provision of non-car modes, then we might expect neighbourhoods with the most excess car ownership to be the least well serviced by alternatives to the car. 

In the graphic below I colour according to the average travel time by foot, bike and public transport combined. From this, it is generally true that neighbourhoods with lower levels of car ownership are, in relative terms, better served by car-alternatives --  lighter squares (longer travel times) are towards the bottom of the graphics. However, the association between car ownership and non-car accessibility is far from linear. In fact, I had to test this by giving cells an entirely random arrangement, to see if the pattern of lighter colours to the bottom and darker to the top still persists. It does -- just about!
```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| echo: false

include_graphics("access_non.png", error = FALSE)

```


## Reordering neighbourhoods by attitudes to switching 

TODO : MRP on NTAS and represent using ordering on propensity to shift

## Cutting through my deliberately contrived analysis

There are of course many reasons why we do not see a strong association between neighbourhood-level car ownership and the relative supply of non-car alternatives, judged by average travel times. 

**Car ownership does not straightforwardly imply *dependency***.  A household may choose to own a car, or several cars, for reasons  other than necessity. In the 1990s pollsters used car ownership as *the* proxy for income; and we know that incomes vary systematically across neighbourhoods in Leeds. After income, other factors such as household composition, size, age profile are also likely to explain differences in car ownership -- all vary by neighbourhood. 

Our measures of the **enabling environment for non-car alternatives**  -- average travel times by foot, bike, PT -- is a **reductive** one. Taking cycling as an example, travel times do not account for differences in [road infrastructure, elevation and the physical environment](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23998083231165122) that are known to determine cycling uptake. In the UK especially, local [cultural attitudes and identities](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2013.11.004) play a large role in shaping cycling behaviour.

Finally, **attitudes** ....




## Conclusion

So what does this quick analysis of neighbourhood-level transport stats imply for the modelling work we're planning through Infuze? 

Firstly, that yes, it will be important to consider how effectively non-car options can meet the everyday travel needs of residents. And clearly it will be hard to 'beat' the private car in models that look to optimise on travel time. But the link between levels of car ownership, attitudes towards reducing car use and provision of transport alternatives, is non-linear. 

Intuitively this makes sense. Certainly we will need, through our modelling, to explore and capture *enabling environments* for alternatives to car in a more detailed and rich way -- and to consider how this local context differently interacts with a range of individual needs and personal circumstances.  

But to truly shift society away from the current status quo, we must engage with values, beliefs, social learning that happens alongside more  fundamental "paradigmatic" change. This understanding is, in any case, our [starting point with Infuze](https://in-fuze.org.uk/project/).
