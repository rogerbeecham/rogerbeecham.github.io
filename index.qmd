Hi! Thanks for visiting my website. If you find anything useful here, or on my [github](https://github.com/rogerbeecham), and would like to know more, do get in touch. 


I'm an Associate Professor in visual data science at the School of Geography, [University of Leeds](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography/staff/1003/dr-roger-beecham) and Director of Research & Innovation at [Leeds Institute for Data Analytics](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/). I joined Leeds in 2017 after completing a PhD and postdoc at the [giCentre](https://www.gicentre.net/). I publish methods-oriented research in data visualization ([IEEE TVCG](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=2945) | [CGF](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14678659)) and spatial analysis ([GA](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15384632)), as well as applied studies in transport ([AAP](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/accident-analysis-and-prevention) | [TRC](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/transportation-research-part-c-emerging-technologies) | [TRA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/transportation-research-part-a-policy-and-practice)) and geography ([E&P A](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/epn) | [E&P B](https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/EPB/current) | [JoTG](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-transport-geography)). 

My work typically proposes, tests and applies visual methods that help analysts to understand and communicate complex (spatial) processes under uncertainty; I'm especially interested in how visualization relates to statistical issues (see [Beecham and Lovelace 2023](research/articles/visinferences/) and my recent [Turing Methods Challenge](https://theory4ida.github.io/tmcf/) w/ [Cagatay Turkay](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/cim/people/cagatay-turkay/)). Many of these ideas are explored in my book, to be published with [CRC Press in 2025](https://www.routledge.com/Visualization-for-Social-Data-Science/Beecham/p/book/9781032259710) ([development version](https://vis4sds.github.io/vis4sds/)). 

{{< fa bullhorn size=large >}}  This is what I'm doing right [now](now/).
